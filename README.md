# js-deep-dive

A curated collection of JavaScript fundamentals, language internals, and core patterns, explored through hands-on implementations and small experiments.

This repository focuses on **understanding how JavaScript works under the hood** rather than just using APIs or frameworks.

---

## Why this repository?

Modern JavaScript frameworks abstract away many details, but strong engineers understand the fundamentals.

This repo is my ongoing effort to:
- Build a solid mental model of JavaScript
- Explore language mechanics and edge cases
- Implement commonly asked patterns from first principles
- Practice writing clean, readable, and predictable JavaScript
